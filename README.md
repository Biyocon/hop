### a brief description of how I used Supabase
I used Supabase
* auth
* store data
* function to build an API

### any other info I want the judges to know

* I was interested in Solid.js, so I used it this time as a way to learn about a new technology.

* During the pandemic, I had a very difficult time finding a job in Canada as an immigrant. In the process, I thought that job hunting in particular should be more fun.
I felt that existing job sites had a lot of text and overall very boring designs, and these made the job search process boring. I created Hop in the hope that I could change this situation, even if only a little.
